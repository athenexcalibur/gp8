\section{Introduction}

7.5 million tonnes of food went to waste in 2015, 4.4 million tonnes of which was edible.
This has a retail value of around £13 billion, and is associated with 19 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emmisions
(which is around a quarter of that emitted by road traffic in the UK)\cite{wrap}.
Meanwhile food banks are becoming busier every year \cite{trussel} and 8.4 million people in the UK alone struggling to pay for food \cite{voth}.\\
Much of this is simply because the expiry date has passed. However, `dates are not an indicator of the product’s safety' \cite{USDA} and food can remain perfectly edible after the expiry date.
From an environmental, economical, and ethical point of view this is a completely needless travesty.\\
Cupboard aims to be a system that allows users to painlessly find and share food
that would otherwise go to waste. A priority is speed and ease of use, as it is
too easy to just throw away food. 
It will also allow users to arrange collection in a manner that does not force
them to disclose their house address or any other details they wish to keep
private.

The main sections of this document are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Project Scope:} Here we give an overview about what our system will (and won't) do. Identification of the target audience and possible future features.
	\item \textbf{Domain analysis:} An analysis of similar products already in place.
	\item \textbf{Proposed Deliverables:} How we plan to undergo the project.
	\item \textbf{Identified, Risks, Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints:}
        A discussion of things we must consider and keep in mind as we move forward.
	\item \textbf{Solution Requirements:} Planned functional and non-functional requirements.
	\item \textbf{Development Approach:} A brief overview of the technologies we plan to use in order to develop the product.
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Scope}
\subsection{What Cupboard will do}
The aim is to become a go-to everyday service that people will use `by default'
without even thinking about wasting food. This means users will be able to
easily list items with a minimal amount of effort.\\
There will be a simple points-based system and a ranking system in order to
encourage sharing of food and to reassure other users that the quality of food is
likely to be good. When some food has been successfully exchanged both
parties will get points and will be able to rate the other based on their experience. If users wish to
participate, there will be a simple public leaderboard.\\
Users can set their dietary requirements (allergies, religious etc.) and have
results automatically filtered. This will allow users to find food even more quickly, as they do not need to manually filter out innapropriate foods.\\
There will be a messaging system (in order to arrange collection) and a comments
system (in order to view interest in the item and ask questions). \\
We also are strictly not-for-profit, and will not allow users to demand money for their leftovers. There will be no
advertisements on our site.

\subsection{What Cupboard won't do}
We wish to follow the UNIX philosophy of `doing one thing and doing it well'. As mentioned above,
our `one thing' is the prevention of food waste by donating food to people who want it.
We have user accounts, a messaging system, comments, and a leaderboard only to facilitate the sharing of food.
Social media features (such as friend requests, status updates, etc) will not feature in our product.

\subsection{Target audience}
Our plans are to keep the interface incredibly simple and as accessible as possible. 
Ideally, anyone who can browse the internet will be able to find and share food via our platform.\\
That said, we have identified four main user groups which we think will benefit most from our service:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Families:} When cooking for a group it can be hard to know in advance how much you should prepare.
			It is common to prepare more than you need and throw away what remains.
			Our service must therefore be family friendly, which means no explicit language, advertisements etc.
	\item \textbf{Stores and resturants:} Stores are reluctant so sell food after the `best-before' date, despite it being perfectly legal \cite{govuk}.
			Resturants commonly throw away completley edible trimmings in order to make meals more aesthetic. Our service will allow them to advertise food,
			similarly to the `FoodCloud' service mentioned below in the Domain Analysis.
	\item \textbf{Students:} Preparing single meals can be tough and wasteful. Our service will allow students to find dinner if they can't cook, or share food
			with other students if they do cook and find they've prepared too much.
	\item \textbf{The needy:} Most importantly, our service will allow those who do not have the means to afford food to feed themselves whilst preventing food waste.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future features}
The features we plan to implement are plenty and should make a sizeable dent in our food wastage problem. There are, however, several features
that we would implement after the initial launch of the system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Featured listings:} Large stores and resturants may sign up to be `featured users'. Generally, food from these places will be of high-quality
		(i.e, still boxed, only just past the sell-by date) and users will feel more comfortable picking up food from a store. Listings from these users will
		be promoted in search results. \textit{Note: this is not a paid feature}.
	\item \textbf{Mobile application:} To make the service even more accessible we may develop a mobile application. This will include a barcode scanner, so that users
		can list something in a matter of seconds.
	\item \textbf{Statistics:} Anonymous statistics can be gathered so that we may find out roughly how much food waste our system is preventing.
	\item \textbf{Volunteer service:} Particularly vunerable people (such as the elderly or disabled) may not be able to leave the house easily. There are charities
		that help by delivering food to these people. One such charity is mentioned in the next section.
	\item \textbf{Donations:} As mentioned above, we will not be for profit. However, we might collect donations to cover server costs, with the rest being distributed
		to relevant charities.
	\item \textbf{Education:} It may be useful to develop a short series of guides, containing tips and tricks to help people make better use of their food.
\end{itemize}


\section{Domain Analysis}

The domain of our project encompasses online marketplaces and sites for purchasing food.
There are a number of sites which already occupy these domains,
the design of which we will draw from in designing our own site.

\begin{itemize}

    \item eBay \cite{ebay}: An online marketplace through which users can both list and
        purchase almost anything. When listing an item, users must provide at
        least one photo and information such as title, condition and type, as
        well as an optional description and additional photos.

        This is important as it forces users to provide enough information
        for buyers, and discourages fake listings.
        Users search for items by name, and can sort results in a number of
        ways, which is very useful, however it lacks more options for filtering
        results.
        
        Perhaps the best feature of the site is that every listing displays
        the seller’s username, along with a score and the percentage of all
        the feedback the user has received which is positive.
        This allows buyers to gauge how trustworthy the seller is, and is a
        feature which we feel will work well in our system also.


    \item foodsharing.de \cite{foodsharing}: A food sharing sharing site, currently only available
        in Germany.
        It reduces food waste by allowing users to list food they wish to give
        away, and then arrange a time and place for the volunteer
        “Lebensmittelretter Innen” to collect the food and deliver it to
        whoever wanted it.
        This method removes the risk of potentially dangerous or illegal
        substances being exchanged, as all items are checked by the trusted
        volunteers.
        
        However it introduces the problem of having to have a large number of
        volunteers willing to give up their time. The site itself is quite well
        designed, but navigation is sometimes difficult.

        Every item of food listed has its own page, but we found these pages to
        be lacking, listing only a very brief description most of the time.
        The listings are also all anonymous and there is no system of rating
        users, as in eBay for example, which would allow users to check how
        trustworthy the user providing the food is.
    
    \item Olio \cite{olio}: A mobile app with a strong UK presence.
        Users can share food by manually collecting/delivering it, or through
        "Drop Boxes" - local stores or cafés where users can drop off food
        they'd like to be shared.
        
        However the app has received many negative reviews from users frustrated
        that there is no food they can get near them, which is an issue our
        system is also likely to face, particularly soon after launch.
        
    \item FareShare \cite{fareshare}:
		FareShare is a London-based charity that redistributes food from restaurants
		and grocery stores to other local charities and community-groups. They are similar
		to our proposed platform, and even have a `FoodCloud' service in which large stores
		can alert local charities that they have food available for colllection.\\
		One issue with FareShare is that not anyone can quickly share or find food. There is no available listing of locally available leftovers.
		Local resturants and stores can sign up to donate food, and local charities can sign up to recieve food, however
		if (say) a family of 4 want to donate some leftovers they cannot do so with this service.
\end{itemize}

An interesting feature of the 2 existing food sharing apps listed above is that
their search functions and catalogs are strongly based on location.
They place a lot of emphasis on an interactive map to find items, contrary to
eBay’s method of having the user search for items by name, and then allowing
the user to filter results, indicating perhaps that users are more concerned
about how far they have to travel for food, rather than what that food is.

We feel our system should combine both of these functions, with a search bar
and filtering methods like eBay, but with results sorted by distance from the user.

\section{Identified Risks, Assumptions, Dependencies and Constraints}
\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}

    \item It is possible that users may exploit the rating system,
        through the use of fake reviews and ratings,
        to boost their score and rating, and therefore trick
        other users into believing they are trustworthy when this is not the case.

    \item Users may exploit the system to list and distribute non-food items,
        and particularly nefarious users may even use it to distribute illegal substances.
    
    \item Users may (knowingly or otherwise) distribute food which is dangerous
        to consume, such as if it has gone off.
    
    \item Users may lure others, under the guise of giving them food, into
        potentially perilous predicaments.
    
    \item If the system’s sole database goes down the whole site will be
        useless, since all the data is stored in a single place.
    
    \item It is possible that the system, particularly its databases, could be hacked.
        This could lead to user’s private data, particularly sensitive
        information such as address and email address, being leaked and abused.
    
    \end{itemize}

Should any of these risks occur, or should anything else unfortunate occur
to anyone, but particularly minors, through use of the system,
we may be held accountable.
This in itself is also a risk.
To mitigate this, we will ensure that we mitigate all other risks as much
as possible, and force users to sign agreements waiving all responsibility from us.
The ways we mitigate these risks are detailed in Functional Requirements.

\subsection{Assumptions \& Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}

    \item We assume Google maps will be able to find the vast majority of
        addresses entered by the user.
        This location functionality is thus completely dependent on the Google Maps API.

    \item We assume that when a user searches for something they will find a
        decent number of results.
        This is dependent on enough users listing items on the system,
        otherwise, the system will be useless to people wanting to receive food.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{itemize}

\item We need to ensure that no user’s private information, including address
    and email address, is unnecessarily stored or made public, in order to
    avoid putting their security at risk.
    %In particular, we need ensure the privacy of children under 18.

\item Due to the risk involved in regarding strangers meeting to collect items,
    we will restrict our app to users who are 18 years and older

\item In order to allow it to run quickly even on devices with poor internet,
    the system will be limited in the
    number of performance-detrimental luxuries it can have.

\item Due to a lack of time and relative lack of experience,
    the system will likely not be as attractive or efficient as it would be ideally.

\end{itemize}

\section{Solution Requirements}
\subsection{Functional Requirements}
%move section of speech to development approach
N.B. Due to the highly time-sensitive nature of the project, any low priority
requirements (and thier linked dependencies) may not be implemented.
As such, all low priority requirements are inherently unessential to the
system, and it will remain fully operational with or without them.

\section{Development Approach}

\subsection{Development Strategy}

We plan to execute the project using the agile method of development.

We first design the entire project, which includes wireframes, layouts, color schemes, database structure, soft and hard deadlines, milestones etc. We then implement our plan on the frontend and backend simultaneously, with each task being completed as sprints and tested as it is completed. The frontend and the backend are then combined and tested as a whole, which has been elaborated later under Testing Strategy.
