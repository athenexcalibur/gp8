#Group project: Plan of Action
##Preamble
Hi guys! This is the first prototype of what I feel the website
should look like (Based on the designs made last week courtesy
of Luke and Clare).
Considering It took me a whole week just to make a rough mock-up
of the home-page, I figured it was about time I brought you guys
into this :smiling_imp:.

Below is the list of more specific tasks that I presume building
the site will entail. It would be nice if we can put a name on 
each task so people have a clearer idea of what they need to do
(Chances are it will also help with the contribution matrix we
have to fill in at the end of the term).

I'd also recommend you have a think about which tasks you're
best suited to/ more interested in doing as it would
speed up the process of allocating the tasks on Monday.

**N.B. at the end of the document, you should find a 
proposal on how we push code to the repository, 
though this is open to discussion and I will gladly
consider any "better" alternatives**

##Task List 

* Improve mobile support compatibility:
    * stop sidebar from distorting web content (probably by 
    floating over it rather than shifting all the content to the
    side)
    * keep sidebar fixed when you scroll through main-page content
    (this is also an issue on desktops)

* Refactoring the code:
    * find a way to reduce code duplication (e.g. common items
    such as the navbar and sidebar will be used on several pages).
    I've read briefly about this and php's include function seems
    like the way to go but feel free to come up with better 
    suggestions
    
* 'Backend' features:
    * Link Login form to database to validate users
    * Link Create account form to database to add users
    * Add email verification Functionality
    * Setup common access to database (We discussed putting it
    on AWS).
    * Build Database (Duh!)
    * Link Search bar to database
    * get relevant listings from database based on user location

* Dynamic/'Frontend' features:
    * Changing navbar when user logs in (i.e Change login icon to
    profile icon and dropdown list with links to profile page,
    add listing e.t.c)
    * Getting user location information so 'items near you feature'
    is relevant
    
* Website Design:

* Making Additional Pages/features (Will inevitably lead to 
adding more tasks to the list once identified):
    * Messaging functionality
